# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-And-Prediction
## Introduction ##
### **Business Understanding**
  
Azubi Bank is planning to launch a targeted marketing campaign to promote its term deposit products. To maximize the campaign's success and optimize resource allocation, the bank aims to predict which customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By understanding the factors influencing customer decisions and leveraging predictive modeling, Azubi Bank can focus its efforts on the right customers, improving conversion rates and reducing costs.

#### **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical marketing campaign data to:  
1. Identify key factors that influence customer subscription to term deposits.  
2. Build a robust machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').  

This predictive model will serve as a decision-making tool for Azubi Bank's marketing team, helping them design more effective and personalized campaigns.
